This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Japanese_Sentiment_bert.ipynb`) dedicated to performing sentiment analysis for Japanese text. The project focuses on classifying Japanese text into positive and negative sentiments using the BERT model, specifically fine-tuned on the CHABSA Japanese news article dataset. The notebook also utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library, including the Trainer class for efficient model training.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we concentrate on Japanese text sentiment analysis, which has applications in understanding public opinion, customer feedback analysis, and more.

### Key Components

1. **Data Preparation**: The notebook covers data preprocessing steps to make the CHABSA dataset suitable for sentiment analysis. It includes data loading, cleaning, and labeling.

2. **BERT Model Fine-tuning**: The project fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on the sentiment classification task using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. This step involves model configuration, tokenization, and training.

3. **Training with the Trainer Class**: The Hugging Face Trainer class streamlines the training process, enabling efficient model training with training loops and evaluation.

4. **Inference and Evaluation**: The notebook demonstrates how to use the fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis on new Japanese text data and evaluates its performance.

5. **Deployment and Application**: While not covered in the notebook, the trained model can be deployed and used for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.
